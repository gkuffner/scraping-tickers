# Financial Ticker Data Web Scraper
Python script inspired at a job offer avaliable on a freelancing website. I did not officially worked in such project, I just wrote the code as practice.

## Function
The script reads *(currently unavaliable)* Brazilian financial tickers (debenture, CRI or CRA) from a spreadsheet and looks for their specific desired data on two websites. 
Afterwards, it will write the data on a spreadsheet *(currently unavaliable)* in which the user will be able as it desires.

### Disclaimer: the spreadsheet was avaliable at the job description on a freelancing website, the data within does NOT belong to me and does NOT constitutes an investment recommendation.
